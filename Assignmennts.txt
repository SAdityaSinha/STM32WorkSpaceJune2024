Day : 12-7-24
	1. Led blinking basic
	2. Led blink on blue button ( and reverse )

	1. blink LED at different speed one after another in a cyclic way 
	2. change speed on button pressed
	3. now do the led blinking with external blinking use bread board and led (using port PA1)
	4. get 4 or 8 led and then light to blink from lsb -> msb and on press(PC13) msb->lsb
